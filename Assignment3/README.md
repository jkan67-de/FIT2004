# Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm

## Explanation of Script
The Python script reads the edges text file is read and then put into a list where each index represents a vertex and has a list of all the edges in it. Because the list contains all the edges and is bidirectional, it will have 2E edges, the space complexity will be O(E). Going through every edge to make the list will have time complexity of O(E).


## MSD Radix String Sort
Similar to quicksort, MSD string sort divides an array into manageable subarrays that may each be sorted separately to finish the task. However, unlike quicksort, MSD string sort divides the array into a single subarray for each possible value of the first character, as opposed to the two or three divisions in quicksort.

## Trie
Trie is a type of k-ary search tree used for storing and searching a specific key from a set. Trie structures are good for reducing search complexities.
