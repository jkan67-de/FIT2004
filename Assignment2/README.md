# MSD Radix String Sort

## Explanation of Script
The Python script takes in a text file with a list of strings on separate lines.
It converts this into an array and passes it into the recursive MSD_radix_string_sort function.
Once the sorting is done this sorted list is passed into a function that stores everything into a Trie.


## MSD Radix String Sort
Similar to quicksort, MSD string sort divides an array into manageable subarrays that may each be sorted separately to finish the task. However, unlike quicksort, MSD string sort divides the array into a single subarray for each possible value of the first character, as opposed to the two or three divisions in quicksort.

## Trie
Trie is a type of k-ary search tree used for storing and searching a specific key from a set. Trie structures are good for reducing search complexities.
